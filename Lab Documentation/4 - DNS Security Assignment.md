As we discussed, DNS is a foundational service for the Internet and Enterprise Networking.  As with DHCP,  this importance can also raise some security concerns.  For this assignment:

Research the difference between recursive and iterative DNS queries. In a few sentences, describe the distinction
(a.) What type of attack can occur as a result of enabling DNS recursion on a DNS server for ANY client on the Internet. Explain how the attack works and provide a reference to where you found information about the type of attack.  Be sure the site where you learn the attack from is reputable.  

(b.) Describe in a few sentences how recursion should be configured on an organization's DNS server (the DNS server that hosts the organization's records as well as provide lookup service to the organization's local users.)

Research "DNS Views". In a paragraph, describe how they work and the benefits they provide.
 

4. Research IP Address Management: In a paragraph describe what it is and why many organizations are moving in that direction for managing DNS and DHCP.
